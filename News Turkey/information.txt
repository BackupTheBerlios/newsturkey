News Turkey ALPHA Development Information File
---

Ok, just a few peices of info to clear up before you can start working on NewsTurkey.

1. News Turkey REQUIRES Borland C++ Builder 6 Pro.
2. Borland C++ Builder REQUIRES abfComponents and Toolbar2000 to be able to open the project. These are VCL Libraries that News Turkey uses. Both are free.

abfComponents -

Toolbar2000 -

TBX -
	http://www.g32.org

TXMLDocument VCL Component
	Can be found on Borland's Code Central

These libraries are copyright to their respective owners. I've uploaded the version of these libs that I use to News Turkey's Anonymous FTP space under the used libs folder. You can download them from there.

3. The WindowsXP.RES file in the project allows the program to use many of the slick-looking common controls found in XP. However, this makes it incompatible with anything older than XP. To be able to use under Windows 9x/ME/2000 simply remove this from the project using the Project Manager. It will then compile programmed to use the classic common controls.

That's all for now. Later!
